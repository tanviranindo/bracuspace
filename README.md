## Overview

BRACU Space is an online cloud storage system where user can upload, download, transfer, delete and share files. This
project is built for to serve two goals. One is to implement the project in `MVC` design pattern and another one is to
implement
`OOP` concepts. However, the project was chosen to get hands on cloud services.

## Features

- Users can log in, register and view accounts
- Users can upload, download, transfer view and delete files
- Admin can create, search, edit and delete users
- Admin can create and update roles

## Stacks

### Development

- **Backend** - Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA and Spring Mail
- **Frontend** - Thymeleaf
- **Database** - MySQL

### Deployment

- **Database** - Relational Database
  Service ([RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html))
- **Storage** - DigitalOcean
  Space ([DO](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key)) / Simple
  Storage Service ([S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html))
- **Machine** - Elastic
  Beanstalk ([EB](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/deploying-a-spring-boot-application-on-aws-using-aws-elastic-beanstalk/))
  / Elastic Compute Cloud ([EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-one-create-ec2-resources.html))

## Review

- For developing the application models, views and controllers are packaged in a distributed order for following
  the `MVC`
  design pattern. And, repositories, services and dtos are also distributed.
- For deployment a standard MySQL database was created in `RDS`. And then a bucket in `Space` was created for storing
  the files. But currently each user will be provided a folder to store files only. Only that particular user can access
  that folder. Then, using `EC2` instance machine was created and configured. Lastly, deployed and hosted the
  application in the machine.

## Usage

BRACU Space is fully dependent on cloud services. So, there is no need to create or import any database. But the project
is developed on `JDK 11`. Clone this repository to get the project folder

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tanviranindo/bracuspace.git
```

To build the project

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To run the project in localhost

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Server port is configured as`server.port=5000`. View the live demo in `http://localhost:5000/`.

Login Handles -

```shell
ADMIN
email - admin@gmail.com
password - admin

USER
email - user1@gmail.com
password - user1
```

## Note

For testing the demo, authentication keys are ~~provided. For deploying the application into production, configure the
environments with secret key and switch the environment profile (demo -> prod) and create a
new `application-prod.properties` similar to `application-demo.properties`.

### Change Datasource

Create a new `MySQL` database on local or remote database. Or download the schema from [here](#Attachments).

```properties
spring.datasource.url=${DATABASE_URL}
spring.datasource.username=${USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${PASSWORD}
```

### Change Storage

The project is built on DigitalOcean Space, you need to create a bucket on
either [DigitalOcean Space](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key)
or [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html). DigitalOcean Space also
uses `AWS Java SDK S3`. However, after creating the bucket, credentials need to provided here.

```properties
storage.key=${STORAGE_KEY}
storage.secret=${SECRET_KEY}
storage.endpoint=${ENDPOINT}
storage.region=${REGION}
storage.bucket=${BUCKET_NAME}
```

But there is only one difference between Amazon S3 and DigitalOcean Space which is their authentication building method.
DigitalOcean can authentication with end point configuration whereas S3 calls static credential provider.

### DO Space

```java

@Configuration
public class StorageConfig() {
    private String accessKey;
    private String secretKey;
    private String endPoint;
    private String region;

    @Bean
    public AmazonS3 s3client() {
        AWSCredentials credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(accessKey, secretKey);
        return AmazonS3ClientBuilder
                .standard()
                .withEndpointConfiguration(new AwsClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration(endPoint, region))
                .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
                .build();
    }
}
```

### AWS S3

```java

@Configuration
public class StorageConfig() {
    private String accessKey;
    private String secretKey;
    private String endPoint;
    private String region;

    @Bean
    public AmazonS3 s3Client() {
        AWSCredentials credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(accessKey, secretKey);
        return AmazonS3ClientBuilder
                .standard()
                .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
                .withRegion(region)
                .build();
    }
}
```

### Change Email

To change the email, you need to create your own `SMTP` server or `GMAIL` can be used for sending emails. Change it
accordingly.

```properties
spring.mail.host=${HOST_NAME}
spring.mail.username=${MAIL_ADDRESS}
spring.mail.password=${MAIL_PASSWORD}
spring.mail.port=${SMTP_PORT}
```

### Change Multipart

By default, properties have been configured with 1024MB. For reducing or extending the file upload limit, customization
can be
done here.

```properties
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=${SIZE}
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=${SIZE}
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=${SIZE}
```

Note: In local host the system can handle upload and download upto 10 GB or limit can be customized but in deployed site
it can handle upto 1MB only as for free tier.
